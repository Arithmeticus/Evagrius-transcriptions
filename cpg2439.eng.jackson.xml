      <div type="title" n="title">To the Cæsareans. A defence of his withdrawal, and concerning the
         faith. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="1">I have often been astonished at your feeling towards me as you do, and
         how it comes about that an individual so small and insignificant, and having, may be, very
         little that is lovable about him, should have so won your allegiance. You remind me of the
         claims of friendship and of fatherland, and press me urgently in your attempt to make me
         come back to you, as though I were a runaway from a father’s heart and home. That I am a
         runaway I confess. I should be sorry to deny it; since you are already regretting me, you
         shall be told the cause. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="2">I was astounded like a man stunned by some sudden noise. I did not
         crush my thoughts, but dwelt upon them as I fled, and now I have been absent from you a
         considerable time. Then I began to yearn for the divine doctrines, and the philosophy that
         is concerned with them. How, said I, could I overcome the mischief dwelling with us? Who is
         to be my Laban, setting me free from Esau, and leading me to the supreme philosophy? </div>
      <div type="sect" n="3">By God’s help, I have, so far as in me lies, attained my object; I have
         found a chosen vessel, a deep well; I mean Gregory, Christ’s mouth. Give me, therefore, I
         beg you, a little time. I am not embracing a city life. I am quite well aware how the evil
         one by such means devises deceit for mankind, but I do hold the society of the saints most
         useful. For in the more constant change of ideas about the divine dogmas I am acquiring a
         lasting habit of contemplation. Such is my present situation. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="4">Friends godly and well beloved, do, I implore you, beware of the
         shepherds of the Philistines; let them not choke your wills unawares; let them not befoul
         the purity of your knowledge of the faith. This is ever their object, not to teach simple
         souls lessons drawn from Holy Scripture, but to mar the harmony of the truth by heathen
         philosophy. Is not he an open Philistine who is introducing the terms “unbegotten” and
         “begotten” into our faith, and asserts that there was once a time when the Everlasting was
         not; that He who is by nature and eternally a Father became a Father; that the Holy Ghost
         is not eternal? He bewitches our Patriarch’s sheep that they may not drink “of the well of
         water springing up into everlasting life,” but may rather bring upon themselves the words
         of the prophet, “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed them out
         cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water;” when all the while they ought to
         confess that the Father is God, the Son God, and the Holy Ghost God, as they have been
         taught by the divine words, and by those who have understood them in their highest sense. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="5">Against those who cast it in our teeth that we are Tritheists, let it
         be answered that we confess one God not in number but in nature. For everything which is
         called one in number is not one absolutely, nor yet simple in nature; but God is
         universally confessed to be simple and not composite. God therefore is not one in number. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="6">What I mean is this. We say that the world is one in number, but not
         one by nature nor yet simple; for we divide it into its constituent elements, fire, water,
         air, and earth. Again, man is called one in number. We frequently speak of one man, but man
         who is composed of body and soul is not simple. Similarly we say one angel in number, but
         not one by nature nor yet simple, for we conceive of the hypostasis of the angel as essence
         with sanctification. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="7">If therefore everything which is one in number is not one in nature,
         and that which is one and simple in nature is not one in number; and if we call God one in
         nature how can number be charged against us, when we utterly exclude it from that blessed
         and spiritual nature? Number relates to quantity; and quantity is conjoined with bodily
         nature, for number is of bodily nature. We believe our Lord to be Creator of bodies.
         Wherefore every number indicates those things which have received a material and
         circumscribed nature. Monad and Unity on the other hand signify the nature which is simple
         and incomprehensible. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="8">Whoever therefore confesses either the Son of God or the Holy Ghost to
         be number or creature introduces unawares a material and circumscribed nature. And by
         circumscribed I mean not only locally limited, but a nature which is comprehended in
         foreknowledge by Him who is about to educe it from the non-existent into the existent and
         which can be comprehended by science. Every holy thing then of which the nature is
         circumscribed and of which the holiness is acquired is not insusceptible of evil. But the
         Son and the Holy Ghost are the source of sanctification by which every reasonable creature
         is hallowed in proportion to its virtue. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="9">We in accordance with the true doctrine speak of the Son as neither
         like, nor unlike the Father. Each of these terms is equally impossible, for like and unlike
         are predicated in relation to quality, and the divine is free from quality. We, on the
         contrary, confess identity of nature and accepting the consubstantiality, and rejecting the
         composition of the Father, God in substance, Who begat the Son, God in substance. From this
         the consubstantiality is proved. For God in essence or substance is co-essential or
         con-substantial with God in essence or substance. But when even man is called “god” as in
         the words, “I have said ye are gods,” and “dæmon” as in the words, “The gods of the nations
         are dæmons,” in the former case the name is given by favour, in the latter untruly. God
         alone is substantially and essentially God. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="10">When I say “alone” I set forth the holy and uncreated essence and
         substance of God. For the word “alone” is used in the case of any individual and generally
         of human nature. In the case of an individual, as for instance of Paul, that he alone was
         caught into the third heaven and “heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man
         to utter,” and of human nature, as when David says, “as for man his days are as grass,” not
         meaning any particular man, but human nature generally; for every man is short-lived and
         mortal. So we understand these words to be said of the nature, “who alone hath immortality”
         and “to God only wise,” and “none is good save one, that is God,” for here “one” means the
         same as alone. So also, “which alone spreadest out the heavens,” and again “Thou shalt
         worship the Lord thy God and Him only shalt thou serve.” “There is no God beside me.” </div>
      <div type="sect" n="11">In Scripture “one” and “only” are not predicated of God to mark
         distinction from the Son and the Holy Ghost, but to except the unreal gods falsely so
         called. As for instance, “The Lord alone did lead them and there was no strange god with
         them,” and “then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth, and did serve
         the Lord only.” And so St. Paul, “For as there be gods many and lords many, but to us there
         is but one god, the Father, of whom are all things; and one Lord Jesus Christ by Whom are
         all things.” </div>
      <div type="sect" n="12">Here we enquire why when he had said “one God” he was not content, for
         we have said that “one” and “only” when applied to God, indicate nature. Why did he add the
         word Father and make mention of Christ? Paul, a chosen vessel, did not, I imagine, think it
         sufficient only to preach that the Son is God and the Holy Ghost God, which he had
         expressed by the phrase “one God,” without, by the further addition of “the Father,”
         expressing Him of Whom are all things; and, by mentioning the Lord, signifying the Word by
         Whom are all things; and yet further, by adding the words Jesus Christ, announcing the
         incarnation, setting forth the passion and publishing the resurrection. For the word Jesus
         Christ suggests all these ideas to us. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="13">For this reason too before His passion our Lord deprecates the
         designation of “Jesus Christ,” and charges His disciples to “tell no man that He was Jesus,
         the Christ.” For His purpose was, after the completion of the œconomy, after His
         resurrection from the dead, and His assumption into heaven, to commit to them the preaching
         of Him as Jesus, the Christ. Such is the force of the words “That they may know Thee the
         only true God and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent,” and again “Ye believe in God, believe
         also in me.” Everywhere the Holy Ghost secures our conception of Him to save us from
         falling in one direction while we advance in the other, heeding the theology but neglecting
         the œconomy, and so by omission falling into impiety. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="14">Now let us examine, and to the best of our ability explain, the
         meaning of the words of Holy Scripture, which our opponents seize and wrest to their own
         sense, and urge against us for the destruction of the glory of the Only-begotten. First of
         all take the words “I live because of the Father,” for this is one of the shafts hurled
         heavenward by those who impiously use it. These words I do not understand to refer to the
         eternal life; for whatever lives because of something else cannot be self-existent, just as
         that which is warmed by another cannot be warmth itself; but He Who is our Christ and God
         says, “I am the life.” I understand the life lived because of the Father to be this life in
         the flesh, and in this time. Of His own will He came to live the life of men. He did not
         say “I have lived because of the Father,” but “I live because of the Father,” clearly
         indicating the present time, </div>
      <div type="sect" n="15">and the Christ, having the word of God in Himself, is able to call the
         life which He leads, life, and that this is His meaning we shall learn from what follows.
         “He that eateth me,” He says, “he also shall live because of me;” for we eat His flesh, and
         drink His blood, being made through His incarnation and His visible life partakers of His
         Word and of His Wisdom. For all His mystic sojourn among us He called flesh and blood, and
         set forth the teaching consisting of practical science, of physics, and of theology,
         whereby our soul is nourished and is meanwhile trained for the contemplation of actual
         realities. This is perhaps the intended meaning of what He says. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="16">And again, “My Father is greater than I.” This passage is also
         employed by the ungrateful creatures, the brood of the evil one. I believe that even from
         this passage the consubstantiality of the Son with the Father is set forth. For I know that
         comparisons may properly be made between things which are of the same nature. We speak of
         angel as greater than angel, of man as juster than man, of bird as fleeter than bird. If
         then comparisons are made between things of the same species, and the Father by comparison
         is said to be greater than the Son, then the Son is of the same substance as the Father. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="17">But there is another sense underlying the expression. In what is it
         extraordinary that He who “is the Word and was made flesh” confesses His Father to be
         greater than Himself, when He was seen in glory inferior to the angels, and in form to men?
         For “Thou hast made him a little lower than the angels,” and again “Who was made a little
         lower than the angels,” and “we saw Him and He had neither form nor comeliness, his form
         was deficient beyond all men.” </div>
      <div type="sect" n="18">All this He endured on account of His abundant loving kindness towards
         His work, that He might save the lost sheep and bring it home when He had saved it, and
         bring back safe and sound to his own land the man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho
         and so fell among thieves. Will the heretic cast in His teeth the manger out of which he in
         his unreasonableness was fed by the Word of reason? Will he, because the carpenter’s son
         had no bed to lie on, complain of His being poor? This is why the Son is less than the
         Father; for your sakes He was made dead to free you from death and make you sharer in
         heavenly life. It is just as though any one were to find fault with the physician for
         stooping to sickness, and breathing its foul breath, that he may heal the sick. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="19">It is on thy account that He knows not the hour and the day of
         judgment. Yet nothing is beyond the ken of the real Wisdom, for “all things were made by
         Him;” and even among men no one is ignorant of what he has made. But this is His
         dispensation because of thine own infirmity, that sinners be not plunged into despair by
         the narrow limits of the appointed period, no opportunity for repentance being left them;
         and that, on the other hand, those who are waging a long war with the forces of the enemy
         may not desert their post on account of the protracted time. For both of these classes He
         arranges by means of His assumed ignorance; for the former cutting the time short for their
         glorious struggle’s sake; for the latter providing an opportunity for repentance because of
         their sins. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="20">In the gospels He numbered Himself among the ignorant, on account, as
         I have said, of the infirmity of the greater part of mankind. In the Acts of the Apostles,
         speaking, as it were, to the perfect apart, He says, “It is not for you to know the times
         or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.” Here He implicitly excepts
         Himself. So much for a rough statement by way of preliminary attack. Now let us enquire
         into the meaning of the text from a higher point of view. Let me knock at the door of
         knowledge, if haply I may wake the Master of the house, Who gives the spiritual bread to
         them who ask Him, since they whom we are eager to entertain are friends and brothers. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="21">Our Saviour’s holy disciples, after getting beyond the limits of human
         thought, and then being purified by the word, are enquiring about the end, and longing to
         know the ultimate blessedness which our Lord declared to be unknown to His angels and to
         Himself. He calls all the exact comprehension of the purposes of God, a day; and the
         contemplation of the One-ness and Unity, knowledge of which He attributes to the Father
         alone, an hour. I apprehend, therefore, that God is said to know of Himself what is; and
         not to know what is not; God, Who is, of His own nature, very righteousness and wisdom, is
         said to know righteousness and wisdom; but to be ignorant of unrighteousness and
         wickedness; for God who created us is not unrighteousness and wickedness. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="22">If, then, God is said to know about Himself that which is, and not to
         know that which is not; and if our Lord, according to the purpose of the Incarnation and
         the denser doctrine, is not the ultimate object of desire; then our Saviour does not know
         the end and the ultimate blessedness. But He says the angels do not know; that is to say,
         not even the contemplation which is in them, nor the methods of their ministries are the
         ultimate object of desire. For even their knowledge, when compared with the knowledge which
         is face to face, is dense. Only the Father, He says, knows, since He is Himself the end and
         the ultimate blessedness, for when we no longer know God in mirrors and not immediately,
         but approach Him as one and alone, then we shall know even the ultimate end. For all
         material knowledge is said to be the kingdom of Christ; while immaterial knowledge, and so
         to say the knowledge of actual Godhead, is that of God the Father. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="23">But our Lord is also Himself the end and the ultimate blessedness
         according to the purpose of the Word; for what does He say in the Gospel? “I will raise him
         up at the last day.” He calls the transition from material knowledge to immaterial
         contemplation a resurrection, speaking of that knowledge after which there is no other, as
         the last day: for our intelligence is raised up and roused to a height of blessedness at
         the time when it contemplates the One-ness and Unity of the Word. But since our
         intelligence is made dense and bound to earth, it is both commingled with clay and
         incapable of gazing intently in pure contemplation, being led through adornments cognate to
         its own body. It considers the operations of the Creator, and judges of them meanwhile by
         their effects, to the end that growing little by little it may one day wax strong enough to
         approach even the actual unveiled Godhead. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="24">This is the meaning, I think, of the words “my Father is greater than
         I,” and also of the statement, “It is not mine to give save to those for whom it is
         prepared by my Father.” This too is what is meant by Christ’s “delivering up the kingdom to
         God even the Father;” inasmuch as according to the denser doctrine which, as I said, is
         regarded relatively to us and not to the Son Himself, He is not the end but the first
         fruits. It is in accordance with this view that when His disciples asked Him again in the
         Acts of the Apostles, “When wilt thou restore the kingdom of Israel?” He replied, “It is
         not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power.”
         That is to say, the knowledge of such a kingdom is not for them that are bound in flesh and
         blood. This contemplation the Father hath put away in His own power, meaning by “power”
         those that are empowered, and by “His own” those who are not held down by the ignorance of
         things below. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="25">Do not, I beg you, have in mind times and seasons of sense but certain
         distinctions of knowledge made by the sun apprehended by mental perception. For our Lord’s
         prayer must be carried out. It is Jesus Who prayed “Grant that they may be one in us as I
         and Thou are one, Father.” For when God, Who is one, is in each, He makes all out; and
         number is lost in the in-dwelling of Unity. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="26">This is my second attempt to attack the text. If any one has a better
         interpretation to give, and can consistently with true religion amend what I say, let him
         speak and let him amend, and the Lord will reward him for me. There is no jealousy in my
         heart. I have not approached this investigation of these passages for strife and vain
         glory. I have done so to help my brothers, lest the earthen vessels which hold the treasure
         of God should seem to be deceived by stony-hearted and uncircumcised men, whose weapons are
         the wisdom of folly. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="27">Again, as is said through Solomon the Wise in the Proverbs, “He was
         created;” and He is named “Beginning of ways” of good news, which lead us to the kingdom of
         heaven. He is not in essence and substance a creature, but is made a “way” according to the
         œconomy. Being made and being created signify the same thing. As He was made a way, so was
         He made a door, a shepherd, an angel, a sheep, and again a High Priest and an Apostle, the
         names being used in other senses. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="28">What again would the heretics say about God unsubjected, and about His
         being made sin for us? For it is written “But when all things shall be subdued unto Him,
         then shall the Son also Himself be subject unto Him that put all things under Him.” Are you
         not afraid, sir, of God called unsubjected? For He makes thy subjection His own; and
         because of thy struggling against goodness He calls himself unsubjected. In this sense too
         He once spoke of Himself as persecuted—“Saul, Saul,” He says, “why persecutest thou me?” on
         the occasion when Saul was hurrying to Damascus with a desire to imprison the disciples.
         Again He calls Himself naked, when any one of his brethren is naked. “I was naked,” He
         says, “and ye clothed me;” and so when another is in prison He speaks of Himself as
         imprisoned, for He Himself took away our sins and bare our sicknesses. Now one of our
         infirmities is not being subject, and He bare this. So all the things which happen to us to
         our hurt He makes His own, taking upon Him our sufferings in His fellowship with us. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="29">But another passage is also seized by those who are fighting against
         God to the perversion of their hearers: I mean the words “The Son can do nothing of
         Himself.” To me this saying too seems distinctly declaratory of the Son’s being of the same
         nature as the Father. For if every rational creature is able to do anything of himself, and
         the inclination which each has to the worse and to the better is in his own power, but the
         Son can do nothing of Himself, then the Son is not a creature. And if He is not a creature,
         then He is of one essence and substance with the Father. Again; no creature can do what he
         likes. But the Son does what He wills in heaven and in earth. Therefore the Son is not a
         creature. Again; all creatures are either constituted of contraries or receptive of
         contraries. But the Son is very righteousness, and immaterial. Therefore the Son is not a
         creature, and if He is not a creature, He is of one essence and substance with the Father. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="30">This examination of the passages before us is, so far as my ability
         goes, sufficient. Now let us turn the discussion on those who attack the Holy Spirit, and
         cast down every high thing of their intellect that exalts itself against the knowledge of
         God. You say that the Holy Ghost is a creature. And every creature is a servant of the
         Creator, for “all are thy servants.” If then He is a servant, His holiness is acquired; and
         everything of which the holiness is acquired is receptive of evil; but the Holy Ghost being
         holy in essence is called “fount of holiness.” Therefore the Holy Ghost is not a creature.
         If He is not a creature, He is of one essence and substance with the Father. How, tell me,
         can you give the name of servant to Him Who through your baptism frees you from your
         servitude? “The law,” it is said, “of the Spirit of life hath made me free from the law of
         sin.” </div>
      <div type="sect" n="31">But you will never venture to call His nature even variable, so long
         as you have regard to the nature of the opposing power of the enemy, which, like lightning,
         is fallen from heaven and fell out of the true life because its holiness was acquired, and
         its evil counsels were followed by its change. So when it had fallen away from the Unity
         and had cast from it its angelic dignity, it was named after its character “Devil,” its
         former and blessed condition being extinct and this hostile power being kindled. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="32">Furthermore if he calls the Holy Ghost a creature he describes His
         nature as limited. How then can the two following passages stand? “The Spirit of the Lord
         filleth the world;” and “Whither shall I go from thy Spirit?” But he does not, it would
         seem, confess Him to be simple in nature; for he describes Him as one in number. And, as I
         have already said, everything that is one in number is not simple. And if the Holy Spirit
         is not simple, He consists of essence and sanctification, and is therefore composite. But
         who is mad enough to describe the Holy Spirit as composite, and not simple, and
         consubstantial with the Father and the Son? </div>
      <div type="sect" n="33">If we ought to advance our argument yet further, and turn our
         inspection to higher themes, let us contemplate the divine nature of the Holy Spirit
         specially from the following point of view. In Scripture we find mention of three
         creations. The first is the evolution from non-being into being. The second is change from
         the worse to the better. The third is the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find
         the Holy Ghost cooperating with the Father and the Son. There is a bringing into existence
         of the heavens; and what says David? “By the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all
         the host of them by the breath of His mouth.” Again, man is created through baptism, for
         “if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.” And why does the Saviour say to the
         disciples, “Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father
         and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost”? Here too you see the Holy Ghost present with the
         Father and the Son. And what would you say also as to the resurrection of the dead when we
         shall have failed and returned to our dust? Dust we are and unto dust we shall return. And
         He will send the Holy Ghost and create us and renew the face of the earth. For what the
         holy Paul calls resurrection David describes as renewal. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="34">Let us hear, once more, him who was caught into the third heaven. What
         does he say? “You are the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you.” Now every temple is a
         temple of God, and if we are a temple of the Holy Ghost, then the Holy Ghost is God. It is
         also called Solomon’s temple, but this is in the sense of his being its builder. And if we
         are a temple of the Holy Ghost in this sense, then the Holy Ghost is God, for “He that
         built all things is God.” If we are a temple of one who is worshipped, and who dwells in
         us, let us confess Him to be God, for thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and Him only
         shalt thou serve. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="35">Supposing them to object to the word “God,” let them learn what this
         word means. God is called Θεὸς either because He placed (τεθεικέναι) all things or because
         He beholds (Θεᾶσθαι) all things. If He is called Θεὸς because He “placed” or “beholds” all
         things, and the Spirit knoweth all the things of God, as the Spirit in us knoweth our
         things, then the Holy Ghost is God. Again, if the sword of the spirit is the word of God,
         then the Holy Ghost is God, inasmuch as the sword belongs to Him of whom it is also called
         the word. Is He named the right hand of the Father? For “the right hand of the Lord
         bringeth mighty things to pass;” and “thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces the
         enemy.” But the Holy Ghost is the finger of God, as it is said “if I by the finger of God
         cast out devils,” of which the version in another Gospel is “if I by the Spirit of God cast
         out devils.” So the Holy Ghost is of the same nature as the Father and the Son. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="36">So much must suffice for the present on the subject of the adorable
         and holy Trinity. It is not now possible to extend the enquiry about it further. Do ye take
         seeds from a humble person like me, and cultivate the ripe ear for yourselves, for, as you
         know, in such cases we look for interest. But I trust in God that you, because of your pure
         lives, will bring forth fruit thirty, sixty, and a hundred fold. For, it is said, Blessed
         are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="37">And, my brethren, entertain no other conception of the kingdom of the
         heavens than that it is the very contemplation of realities. This the divine Scriptures
         call blessedness. For “the kingdom of heaven is within you.” The inner man consists of
         nothing but contemplation. The kingdom of the heavens, then, must be contemplation. Now we
         behold their shadows as in a glass; hereafter, set free from this earthly body, clad in the
         incorruptible and the immortal, we shall behold their archetypes, we shall see them, that
         is, if we have steered our own life’s course aright, and if we have heeded the right faith,
         for otherwise none shall see the Lord. For, it is said, into a malicious soul Wisdom shall
         not enter, nor dwell in the body that is subject unto sin. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="38">And let no one urge in objection that, while I am ignoring what is
         before our eyes, I am philosophizing to them about bodiless and immaterial being. It seems
         to me perfectly absurd, while the senses are allowed free action in relation to their
         proper matter, to exclude mind alone from its peculiar operation. Precisely in the same
         manner in which sense touches sensible objects, so mind apprehends the objects of mental
         perception. This too must be said that God our Creator has not included natural faculties
         among things which can be taught. No one teaches sight to apprehend colour or form, nor
         hearing to apprehend sound and speech, nor smell, pleasant and unpleasant scents, nor
         taste, flavours and savours, nor touch, soft and hard, hot and cold. Nor would any one
         teach the mind to reach objects of mental perception; and just as the senses in the case of
         their being in any way diseased, or injured, require only proper treatment and then readily
         fulfil their own functions; just so the mind, imprisoned in flesh, and full of the thoughts
         that arise thence, requires faith and right conversation which make “its feet like hinds’
         feet, and set it on its high places.” </div>
      <div type="sect" n="39">The same advice is given us by Solomon the wise, who in one passage
         offers us the example of the diligent worker the ant, and recommends her active life; and
         in another the work of the wise bee in forming its cells, and thereby suggests a natural
         contemplation wherein also the doctrine of the Holy Trinity is contained, if at least the
         Creator is considered in proportion to the beauty of the things created. </div>
      <div type="sect" n="40">But with thanks to the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost let me make
         an end to my letter, for, as the proverb has it, πᾶν μέτρον ἄριστον. </div>
